üìå How to Name Your Issues & Pull Requests
When you create an Issue or a Pull Request, the title should follow a specific format called Conventional Commits. This helps us understand what your changes are about at a glance.

# üîñ Prefixes You Should Use
Choose one of the following prefixes to start your title:
ALso, first letter should be capital after the Prefix.
**FEAT:**
Use this when you're adding a new feature.
Example: FEAT: Add user authentication flow

**FIX:**
Use this when you're fixing a bug or something that's broken.
Example: FIX: Resolve crash when loading dashboard

**DOCS:**
Use this for documentation updates like README or comments in code.
Example: DOCS: Update installation guide

**STYLE:**
Use this for style changes that don't affect the functionality, like formatting, adding spaces, or fixing indentation.
